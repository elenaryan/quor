QGui.py drives the step by step display of a valid quoridor game using the syntax described in the QGui comments.  The program prompts for a text file and displays the game move by move


IN PROGRESS: GameGen.py 
will generate a text file with a valid quoridor game
 OR
generate a series of valid quoridor games and record the game state and victory of each one
